> **Business context:**  
> In many restaurants, tipping is not just a formality – it directly impacts **staff income, customer satisfaction and revenue stability**.  
> This project demonstrates how a restaurant can use **data and machine learning** to better understand tipping patterns, forecast expected tips for different types of bills and groups, and support decisions related to **staff scheduling, promotions and service strategy**.

# Restaurant Tips Analysis & Prediction 💸

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a simple machine learning model to **predict restaurant tips** based on bill amount and customer-related information.  

From a business point of view, the project shows how even a relatively small dataset can be transformed into **actionable insights** about customer behaviour and used to build a **lightweight prediction model** that supports more data-driven decisions in the restaurant environment.

The project is implemented in Python using the standard data science stack:
**pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **scikit-learn**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

- To explore a real-world style dataset of **restaurant bills and tips** and understand its structure, data quality and limitations.
- To analyse how customer and context features such as:
  - total bill,
  - day of the week,
  - time of day (lunch/dinner),
  - sex,
  - smoker/non-smoker,
  - group size  
  relate to the **tip amount** and **tipping rate**.
- To build a **regression model** (Linear Regression) that predicts the expected tip for a given bill and party composition.
- To evaluate the model and reflect on its limitations and possible improvements, both from a **technical** and **business** perspective.

## 💼 Business Problem & Use Cases

In many restaurants, tips can form a **significant part of staff income** and are often an indicator of **customer satisfaction**. However, tipping behaviour is influenced by multiple factors and is rarely tracked or analysed systematically.

This project addresses the following business questions:

- How do **bill size**, **party size**, **day of the week** and **time of day** affect average tip amounts?
- Are there clear patterns that help anticipate **when higher or lower tips are likely**?
- Can we estimate an **expected tip value** for a given bill and party, which might help:
  - calibrate expectations for staff,
  - design **promotions** (e.g. happy hours, weekend offers),
  - adjust **staff scheduling** during times with higher potential earnings?

Although the project is based on a simplified dataset, the same structure can be scaled to:

- internal restaurant data collected from POS systems,
- weekly or monthly performance monitoring,
- building **dashboards** that track tipping behaviour, bill structure and service performance in real time.

## 📂 Dataset

The notebook expects a CSV file named **`tip.csv`** located in the project root.

Typical columns (based on the classic "tips" dataset structure):

- `total_bill` – total bill for the table (float); represents the main monetary value generated by the visit.
- `tip` – tip amount (float, target variable); this is what the model aims to predict.
- `sex` – sex of the payer (e.g. `Male`, `Female`); potential demographic factor that might correlate with tipping.
- `smoker` – smoker in the party? (`Yes` / `No`); may indirectly capture type of clientele or part of the venue.
- `day` – day of the week (`Thu`, `Fri`, `Sat`, `Sun`); often related to different traffic volumes and behaviours.
- `time` – time of day (`Lunch`, `Dinner`); dinners may differ from lunches in average bill size and tipping norms.
- `size` – size of the group (integer); larger groups may split the bill and tip differently from couples or solo guests.
